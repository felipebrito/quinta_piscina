			"taskTitle": "Firmware: Implement Relay Control Logic and WebSocket Handler",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "In `src/main.cpp`, define an array for the 4 relay GPIO pins and a corresponding boolean array to hold their states. In `setup()`, iterate through the pin array to configure each pin as `OUTPUT`. Create a function `void setPumpState(int pumpId, bool state)` that validates the `pumpId`, updates the state array, and calls `digitalWrite`. In the existing `onWsEvent` WebSocket event handler, add logic to parse incoming JSON messages using `ArduinoJson`. If the message `action` is `set_pump`, extract `pump_id` and `state`, then call your new `setPumpState` function.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis indicates a barebones `main.cpp` with web server and WebSocket instances likely present, but no application logic. This task is foundational and requires creating new functions and logic from scratch. Complexity is moderate (4/10) because it involves integrating three distinct components: GPIO hardware control, WebSocket event handling, and JSON parsing (`ArduinoJson`), which must work together seamlessly. It's not just a simple modification but the creation of a core control loop."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Implement Pump Control Switches",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "In the Next.js frontend, locate the React component responsible for rendering a pump's controls (e.g., in `app/page.tsx` or a dedicated `components/PumpCard.tsx`). Assuming a WebSocket context or hook (`useWebSocket`) is available, add an `onCheckedChange` handler to the Shadcn/UI `<Switch>` component. Inside this handler, construct the JSON message `{\"action\": \"set_pump\", \"pump_id\": <pump_index>, \"state\": <new_checked_state>}` and send it using the WebSocket instance's `sendMessage` function.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis assumes a standard Next.js project with Shadcn/UI and a basic WebSocket connection utility already established. This task is low complexity (3/10) as it primarily involves wiring an existing UI component's event (`onCheckedChange`) to an existing WebSocket sending function. It does not require complex state management or new component creation, but rather connecting pre-existing dots."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Firmware: Implement Sensor Reading for DS18B20 and LDR",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "First, add `paulstoffregen/OneWire` and `milesburton/DallasTemperature` to `lib_deps` in `platformio.ini`. In `src/main.cpp`, include the headers, define the `ONE_WIRE_BUS` and LDR ADC pins, and create global instances for `OneWire` and `DallasTemperature`. In `setup()`, initialize the sensors. In the main `loop()`, create a non-blocking timer using `millis()` that triggers every 5 seconds. Inside this timer, call `sensors.requestTemperatures()`, read the value with `getTempCByIndex(0)`, and use `analogRead()` for the LDR, mapping its value to a 0-100 percentage. Store both readings in global state variables.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis shows no existing sensor logic. This task has a medium complexity (5/10) because it requires adding and configuring new libraries (`OneWire`, `DallasTemperature`) and implementing a non-blocking read pattern using `millis()`. Correctly implementing non-blocking timers is crucial for system stability and is more complex than simple linear code, representing a common challenge in embedded development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Firmware: Broadcast Full Device State via WebSocket",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "In `src/main.cpp`, create a new non-blocking timer in the `loop()` function using `millis()` to run every 2 seconds. Implement a new function, `broadcastDeviceState()`, that is called by this timer. Inside this function, create a `StaticJsonDocument` and populate it with the current pump states from the global array and the current sensor values from their global variables, matching the structure `{\"pumps\": [...], \"sensors\": {\"temperature\": ..., \"luminosity\": ...}}`. Serialize the document to a string and broadcast it to all connected WebSocket clients using `ws.textAll()`.",
			"reasoning": "This task builds upon the state variables established in Tasks 1 and 3. The complexity is moderate (4/10) because it involves creating a properly structured and potentially nested JSON object with `ArduinoJson`, which is more involved than simple parsing. It also requires adding another independent `millis()`-based timer to the main loop, which needs to coexist with other timed events without causing interference."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Display Real-time Sensor Data and Pump Status",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "In the main dashboard component (`frontend/app/page.tsx`), define a `useState` hook to hold the entire device state object. Create a `useEffect` hook that listens for new messages from your WebSocket provider. Inside the effect, parse the incoming JSON message and update the state using `setDeviceState`. Then, bind the UI elements to this state: the `checked` prop of each `<Switch>` should be set to `deviceState.pumps[i]`, and text elements should display `deviceState.sensors.temperature` and `deviceState.sensors.luminosity`.",
			"reasoning": "Analysis of the frontend structure suggests a central component for the dashboard. The complexity is moderate (4/10) because this task establishes the primary data-binding loop for the UI. It involves creating a centralized state model, using a `useEffect` for handling asynchronous data, and converting previously uncontrolled components (like the switches from Task 2) into controlled components that react to state changes, which is a key React concept."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Firmware: Persist Pump States in Non-Volatile Storage (NVS)",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "In `src/main.cpp`, include `<Preferences.h>` and instantiate a `Preferences` object. In `setup()`, call `preferences.begin(\"pump-states\", false)`. Use `preferences.getBytes(\"states\", ...)` to read the saved state into your global pump state array and then loop through it, calling `setPumpState` to apply the restored states. Modify the `setPumpState` function to call `preferences.putBytes(\"states\", ...)` to save the entire updated pump state array after any state change.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis shows no usage of NVS. However, this task is of low complexity (2/10) because it uses the high-level and straightforward `Preferences` library, which is a standard part of the ESP32 Arduino core. The implementation involves adding a few lines of code in two well-defined places: `setup()` for reading and the existing `setPumpState` function for writing. It's a simple, self-contained addition."

			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Firmware: Implement REST API for Schedule Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "First, add `#include <LittleFS.h>` and initialize it in `setup()` with `LittleFS.begin(true)`. Then, register three new `AsyncWebServer` routes: 1) `server.on(\"/api/schedules\", HTTP_GET, ...)` to read and return `/schedules.json` from LittleFS. 2) `server.on(\"/api/schedules\", HTTP_POST, ...)` with a body handler to parse the incoming JSON, read the existing file, add the new schedule to a `JsonDocument`, and write it back. 3) `server.on(\"/api/schedules/.*\", HTTP_DELETE, ...)` to extract the ID, read the file, remove the corresponding object from the JSON array, and rewrite the file.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis shows an `AsyncWebServer` instance but no filesystem or REST API endpoints. This task is complex (7/10) because it requires greenfield development of a full CRUD API on a resource-constrained device. It involves multiple new concepts: initializing and using a filesystem (LittleFS), handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE), processing request bodies and URL parameters, and performing robust file-based JSON array manipulation, which is prone to errors."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Firmware: Implement Scheduling Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "In `setup()`, configure the NTP client using `configTime()` with the correct timezone string and NTP server. Create a function to load schedules from `/schedules.json` into a global array of structs at startup. In the main `loop()`, add a new non-blocking timer that runs every 10-15 seconds. Inside this timer, get the current local time using `getLocalTime()`. Iterate through the loaded schedules, comparing the current time against each schedule's active window. If a schedule should be active, call `setPumpState`. Crucially, implement state management to handle conflicts with manual control and to ensure actions are triggered only on state transitions (e.g., when a schedule starts or ends), not on every check.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis confirms no time or scheduling logic exists. This is a high-complexity task (8/10). Time-based logic is inherently complex, with risks related to timezones, DST, and edge cases like midnight rollovers. The most significant challenge, however, is designing a robust state machine that can resolve conflicts between manual user control and the automated schedule, preventing pumps from 'flapping' (turning on and off rapidly) and ensuring predictable behavior. This requires more than simple time comparison; it requires thoughtful architectural design."

		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Create Schedule Management UI",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a new Next.js page at `app/schedules/page.tsx`. On this page, use a `useEffect` hook to `fetch` data from the ESP32's `/api/schedules` endpoint. Render this data using the Shadcn/UI `<Table>` component. Add a `<Button>` that opens a `<Dialog>` containing a form for creating a schedule (with inputs for pump, time, etc.). On form submission, send a `POST` request to `/api/schedules`. In the table, add a delete button to each row that sends a `DELETE` request to `/api/schedules/{id}`. Ensure the table state is refreshed after create or delete operations.",
			"reasoning": "Analysis shows no existing UI for this feature. This is a moderately high complexity frontend task (6/10). While it follows a standard CRUD pattern, it involves creating a significant new feature from scratch: a new page, data fetching for a new API, complex form state management within a dialog, and handling the full lifecycle (Create, Read, Delete) of a data type. It requires composing multiple non-trivial Shadcn/UI components (`Table`, `Dialog`, `Form`) into a cohesive user experience."

			"taskTitle": "Firmware: Implement RGB LED PWM Control",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "In `src/main.cpp`, define the GPIO pins for R, G, and B. In `setup()`, configure three separate LEDC channels using `ledcSetup()` (e.g., channels 0-2, 5000 Hz, 8-bit resolution) and attach each pin to its channel using `ledcAttachPin()`. Create a function `void setRgbColor(int r, int g, int b)` that calls `ledcWrite()` on each channel. Finally, update your WebSocket event handler to parse an `action` of `set_rgb`, extract the nested `color` object from the JSON, and call `setRgbColor()`.",
			"reasoning": "Codebase analysis shows no PWM/LEDC usage. The complexity is moderate (4/10). While not as simple as `digitalWrite`, using the ESP32's LEDC peripheral is a standard procedure. The complexity comes from the multi-step setup process (configuring channels, frequency, resolution, and attaching pins for three separate outputs) and extending the WebSocket JSON parser to handle a nested object for the color data."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Frontend: Add RGB Color Picker to Dashboard",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "First, `npm install react-color`. Create a new component, `RgbControl.tsx`. Use a Shadcn/UI `<Popover>` triggered by a `<Button>` whose background color reflects the current light color. The popover's content should be a color picker from `react-color` (e.g., `<SketchPicker />`). In the `onChangeComplete` handler, construct and send the `{\"action\": \"set_rgb\", ...}` WebSocket message. This component should receive the current color from the main device state to correctly display the button and picker's initial color.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating a new third-party library (`react-color`) into the existing frontend. The complexity is moderate (4/10) as it requires not only adding the component but also managing its state within a popover for better UX, handling its specific event (`onChangeComplete`) to send data, and ensuring it's a fully controlled component by binding its displayed color to the global state received over WebSocket."

			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Firmware: Integrate Tuya IoT SDK for Cloud Connectivity",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Research and add the official `tuya-iot-arduino-sdk` (or equivalent) to `platformio.ini`. Create a `tuya_config.h` to store the Product ID and secret keys from the Tuya platform. In `main.cpp`, implement the extensive boilerplate for initializing the SDK in `setup()`. Implement the necessary callback functions for network events and DP commands. Critically, you must integrate the SDK's main processing function (e.g., `tuya_loop()`) into the existing `loop()` and implement a way to trigger the SDK's WiFi provisioning mode (e.g., via a button press on boot).",
			"reasoning": "This is a greenfield integration of a large, complex, and opinionated third-party SDK. It scores the highest complexity (10/10) because it's an architectural-level change, not just a feature addition. It will deeply impact the main application loop, event handling, and memory usage. The process involves library management, complex configuration, implementing a new network provisioning workflow, and weaving the SDK's required periodic calls into the existing non-blocking structure, which is a significant engineering effort."

			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Tuya Platform: Define Device and Data Points (DPs)",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Log in to the Tuya IoT Developer Platform and create a new product. In the 'Function Definition' section, define the required Data Points (DPs): 1) Four 'Switch' (Boolean) DPs for the pumps. 2) A 'Value' (Integer) DP for temperature. 3) A 'Value' (Integer) DP for luminosity (0-100). 4) A 'String' DP for RGB color control. Carefully name each DP and record the auto-generated DP ID for each one, as these IDs are essential for the firmware implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This is a configuration task on an external platform, not a coding task. The complexity is low (3/10) but not trivial. It requires navigating the Tuya platform's interface and, more importantly, careful data modeling. Choosing the correct DP type and format for each feature is critical for the success of the subsequent firmware integration (Task 14). An error here leads to significant rework later."

			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Firmware: Map Device State to Tuya Data Points (DPs)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a `tuya_dps.h` file to map your recorded DP IDs to meaningful constant names. Implement the main DP command processing callback provided by the Tuya SDK. In it, use a `switch` on the DP ID to call local functions like `setPumpState` or `setRgbColor`. Then, modify all local functions that change state (`setPumpState`, `setRgbColor`, the sensor reading loop) to also call the appropriate Tuya SDK function (e.g., `mcu_dp_update`) to report the change to the cloud. Finally, implement a function to report the initial state of all DPs upon connecting to the Tuya cloud.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex (7/10) because it involves creating the two-way data binding between the device's internal logic and the Tuya cloud. It requires modifying numerous existing functions to add 'reporting' side effects. The core of the complexity lies in implementing the central command-handling callback, which acts as a router for all incoming cloud commands, and ensuring that the two-way synchronization is robust and does not create feedback loops. This meticulous wiring touches almost every feature of the firmware."
